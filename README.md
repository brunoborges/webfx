WebFX
=====
The purpose of this project is to investigate the capabilities of using JavaFX (FXML + JS + CSS) to build rich web pages, instead of using HTML.
With the new Javascript engine, *Nashorn*, the performance of a JavaFX page in FXML and the controllers in JS will be much higher than it is today.
Idea is to build an FX browser, a security layer, a navigation scheme where one FXML can tell the browser to go to another FXML and a protocol for server-side communication.

Running the WebFX browser
=====
1. Get the code
2. Open on NetBeans
3. Click 'Run'
4. Go to the following URL: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8159675/WebFX/samples/index.html

This URL is a pure, static HTML rendered by WebView, with links to sample applications that are pure FXML+CSS+Javascript.
You may also want to go to a HTML5 website, such as this one from Mozilla HTML5 Showcase:

- http://html5demos.com/canvas

Resource Bundles
=====
Supports loading resource bundles from the Web Server hosting the FXML pages. Convetion is having the .properties with the same name as the FXML page.
*Example*
- http://www.mysite.com/login.fxml
- http://www.mysite.com/login.properties

Developer can also offer language/country specifics, i.e. login_pt_BR.properties

Security Layer (planned)
=====
The security layer must provide a sandbox on each tab, to run JavaFX pages. The sandbox must ensure that:
- unsecure code will be run (i.e. local access to files, System.exit, network, etc)
- dialogs/windows can't be created, unless the user gives permition
- access to parent objects (the Tab object, for example)
- provide management and control for long running process, memory consumption, etc.

Navigation Scheme (planned)
=====
The navigation scheme must allow the developer to define links between FXMLs, similar to HTML. The new page must replace the previous.

FX Protocol (optional)
=====
There should be an specific protocol to allow server-side communication. It is already possible though, to use HTTP.
